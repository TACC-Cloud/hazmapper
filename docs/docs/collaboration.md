# Collaboration

## Shared Maps<a id='shared-maps'></a>
As briefly mentioned in the [Maps](maps.md) section, maps that are saved in the DesignSafe project will be shared among the [members of the project](interface.md#members-tab).
These maps will automatically display in the [welcome menu](interface.md#welcome-menu). 
Because of the connection, the addition/deletion of members is also managed by each corresponding DesignSafe project.

## Public Maps<a id='public-maps'></a>
Any map can have a public version of the map through the [public tab of the manage panel](interface.md#public-tab). The generated link will be permanent unless the owner of the map makes the map private, or unless the owner of the map deletes the original map.
